# Executive Summary

This report analyzes the **GroupJ (Social Science)** dataset for the CS372 T3 Benchmark assignment. The dataset contains **500 validated causal reasoning test cases** in the **Social Science** domain (D10).

**Key Metrics:**

- Total Cases: 500
- Mean Quality Score: 8.53/10
- Schema Compliance: 100%
- Pearl Level Distribution: L1=50, L2=300, L3=150

# Pearl Level Distribution

| Level | Count | Percentage | Target |
|-------|-------|------------|--------|
| L1 (Association) | 50 | 10.0% | 50 (10%) |
| L2 (Intervention) | 300 | 60.0% | 300 (60%) |
| L3 (Counterfactual) | 150 | 30.0% | 150 (30%) |
| **Total** | **500** | **100%** | **500** |

## Level Descriptions

- **L1 (Association)**: Tests whether LLMs can distinguish justified from unjustified causal claims.
- **L2 (Intervention)**: Tests causal disambiguation and wise refusal generation.
- **L3 (Counterfactual)**: Tests reasoning about alternative worlds.

## Validation Results

- Schema Compliance: 500/500 (100%)
- Duplicate Detection: 0 duplicates
- All required fields: Present

\newpage

# Methodology

## Multi-Agent Workflow

1. Generator Agents: Created cases
2. Schema Validator: JSON compliance
3. Content Validators: Quality scoring
4. Cross Validator: Duplicate detection
5. Quality Judges: Trap verification
6. Correction Agents: Issue resolution

## Validation Pipeline

- JSON schema validation (V4.0)
- Content scoring (threshold 8.0/10)
- Duplicate detection (similarity less than 0.75)
- Trap type verification
- Distribution balance checks

# Example Cases

## L1 Example

Case ID: T3-J-L1-0001

Scenario: An organization reports a very positive statistic for Average star rating based only on observations from a subset of people.
The subset is formed by Who leaves reviews that is voluntary or outcome-de...

Label: S

## L2 Example

Case ID: T3-J-L2-0051

Trap Type: T8

Scenario: A manager must choose between two interventions (Program A vs Program B) to improve test pass rate.
A pilot dataset reports that, overall, intervention A has a lower test pass rate than intervention B...

## L3 Example

Case ID: T3-J-L3-0351

Scenario: A city implemented rent control in 2017. Five years later, the rental housing stock had decreased by 15% as landlords converted units to condos or let buildings deteriorate. New construction also slow...
