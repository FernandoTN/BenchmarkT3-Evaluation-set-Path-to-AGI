    "scenario": "A state education department analyzes spending data from districts investing between $5,000 and $15,000 per student annually. The data shows a strong positive correlation: each additional $1,000 in per-student spending corresponds to approximately 8 percentile points higher on standardized tests.

    "wise_refusal": "This extrapolation from $5K-$15K to $100K per student is unjustified. Education spending exhibits well-documented diminishing returns: initial investments improve basics like qualified teachers and materials, but additional funds face ceiling effects (students cannot score above 100%), absorption limits (schools cannot productively deploy unlimited resources), and diminishing marginal utility (tenth teacher aide provides less value than first).

    "scenario": "Economists study the effects of minimum wage increases across states where rates varied from $7.25 to $15.00 per hour over a decade. Within this range, they find modest negative effects on employment: each $1 increase correlates with approximately 0.5% reduction in low-wage employment, but the effect is small and some studies show neutral or positive effects due to reduced turnover. A policy group extrapolates this finding to argue that a $50 per hour minimum wage would cause only a 21% reduction in low-wage employment, which they consider an acceptable tradeoff.",

The observed range represents modest perturbations where businesses can absorb costs through reduced profits, slight price increases, or productivity gains. At $50/hour, these adjustment mechanisms break down entirely: most low-wage businesses would become unviable, automation becomes economically imperative, and underground employment would surge.

Diminishing returns occur because police first deter the most preventable crimes; remaining crime involves determined offenders, crimes of passion, or hidden victimization. Opportunity costs become extreme as police spending crowds out social services that address root causes. Civil liberties constraints, community alienation, and crime displacement to unpoliced domains further invalidate the assumed monotonic relationship.

First, 16-hour usage is physically unsustainable, leaving only 8 hours for sleep with no time for school, eating, or other activities, indicating severe confounding conditions. Second, depression scales have ceiling effects, preventing linear extrapolation beyond maximum scores. Third, individuals using social media 16 hours daily likely have pre-existing conditions (severe depression, social isolation, disability) that confound any observed correlation.
